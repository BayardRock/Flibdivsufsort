# FLibDivSufSort

This project is a simple wrapper for the [LibDivSufSort](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort/) Suffix Array Library

* Based on latest as of 2/17/2016
* Compiled 64-bit only, but should be easy to adapt to the 32-bit from source
* Currently Windows only, but I wouldn't mind help adding Linux support

In order to start the scaffolding process run 

    > build.cmd // on windows    
    $ ./build.sh  // on unix
